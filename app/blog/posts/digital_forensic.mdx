this is a ctf challenge from [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/room/securityfootage)

## task : someone broke into our office last night, but they destroyed the hard drives with the security footage. can you recover the footage?
and we got a packet capture file named `securityfootage.pcap`

opened the packet capture file in wireshark, and check the protocol hierarchy. As we can see there are 1108 TCP packets and 1 HTTP packet.

</div>

okay so the next thing i tried was to see if there was an export objects available file → export objects → http

there was no files in the export objects

i started to skim throught the hex dump data to look for clues . . .
and as we can see from the highlighted area content-type: image/jpeg
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DhNz8sr8/2.jpg" alt="hierarchy" />
</div>

now i filter only the packets containing image by using `tcp contains "JFIF"`
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/FrwF85rj/3.jpg" alt="hierarchy" />
</div>

we got 541 packets that contain images

first lets look at the MIME magic number of JPEG [here](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/image/jpeg)

now we just have to copy the hex stream by right clicking on the hex dump and convert the hex to image format

there are many ways to convert from hex to jpeg, i am using an [online converter](https://capitalizemytitle.com/hex-to-image-converter/) (note we should first get rid of the header values first i.e everything before `FF D8 FF` otherwise the image will not be converted)
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/1z6tKw4N/extracted-image.jpg" alt="hierarchy" />
</div>

this is the image i got from converting the second packet, we can contiue converting the packets by a interval of 100 packets to get the rest of the flag
