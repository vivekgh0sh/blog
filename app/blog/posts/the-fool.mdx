Being a nonchalant person may sound a cool way to life your life but it is the shallowest way to live. I was nonchalant & nihilistic person throughout my
teens only to realized that it has no merit whatsoever. Being confined to your own self you are missing out on your growth potential.
>You are the universe experiencing itself - Allen Watts

But when you actively decide to not partake in experiencing the universe, are you still a part of it?

I had the several notions growing up that : 
* "I can do eveything by myself" 
* "I don't need anyone's help" 
* "I'll figure it out by myself"
* "Everythings on the internet why would I need to talk to another human being?"

And the universe hit me hard with the biggest boulder straight in my face during the final days of my father, I experienced that :
* "I cannot do eveything by myself"
* "I need help"
* "I cannot figure it out by myself"
* "I want to talk to another human being"

I was always associated with destruction, anything that I touched used to fall apart, started to internalized that & became obsessed with
 deleting eveything from my life - friends, family, photos, messages, writings, anything that could prove my existence I wanted to destroy it.

I was feeling lonely and depressed - Is this all my life sums upto? A failure? NO!

There is always a voice inside me even though sometimes faint and sutle that yearned for greatness, that knows the potential I have. One good thing that
came out by me being nihilistic is that nothing matters in the end, but in a positive way. There is a liberating feeling to it that whatever I do
in the end I will be nothing, so why not experience the universe to the fullest, to the broadest, to the deepest while we have the chance.

The best way to experience the universe? 

## Be a Fool!

>Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit. ― William Shakespeare

"He inspires courage, for he understands that every day is a chance to open up new areas in your life,
 and with that comes a mixture of anticipation, wonder, awe and curiosity. The fool is there to show that
  you can never really tell what lies ahead, and you can only greet it with joy."
a definition by tina gong about the fool. 

Being a fool to me is about a sense liberty and accepting that I know very less. I am here to learn, understand and experience and in doing so I might look silly
but in the end who cares, right?

## A King

A king commands attention is upright and displays authority. The king is confined in his role as he is ruled by his own throne. He cannot experience liberty.
So go be a fool ! ! ! talk to people, get to know different people, argue with people, understand people, love people, hate people, envy people, admire people,
collaborate with people, compete with people because in the end *It really doesn’t matter what you eat but with whom*. A king cannot do it only 
a fool can.

P.S. I was inspired by pieter levels [blog](https://levels.io/eighteen/) and got motivated to start blogging
and as steve jobs [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc) "you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.
so you have to trust that somehow the dots will connect in your future. You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever . . . . ."

so these blogs are my dots for me to connect them in future. for the two people (one being me) who could make it till the end . . . thankyou for reading and 
what are you waiting for ! ! ! ! go follow me on X & text me how you felt about the blog. bye-bye
