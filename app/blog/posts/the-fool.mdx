Being a nonchalant person may sound a cool way to life your life but it is the shallowest way to live. I was nonchalant & nihilistic person throughout my
teens only to realized that it has no merit whatsoever. Being confined to your own self you are missing out on your growth potential.
>You are the universe experiencing itself - Allen Watts

But when you actively decide to not partake in experiencing the universe, are you still a part of it?

I had the several notions growing up that : 
* "I can do eveything by myself" 
* "I don't need anyone's help" 
* "I'll figure it out by myself"
* "Everythings on the internet why would I need to talk to another human being?"

And the universe hit me hard with the biggest boulder straight in my face during the final days of my father, I experienced that :
* "I cannot do eveything by myself"
* "I need help"
* "I cannot figure it out by myself"
* "I want to talk to another human being"

I was always associated with destruction, anything that I touched used to fall apart, started to internalized that & became obsessed with
 deleting eveything from my life - friends, family, photos, messages, writings, anything that could prove my existence I wanted to destroy it.

I was feeling lonely and depressed - Is this all my life sums upto? A failure? NO!

There is always a voice inside me even though sometimes faint and sutle that yearned for greatness, that knows the potential I have. One good thing that
came out by me being nihilistic is that nothing matters in the end, but in a positive way. There is a liberating feeling to it that whatever I do
in the end I will be nothing, so why not experience the universe to the fullest, to the broadest, to the deepest while we have the chance.

The best way to experience the universe?

>Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit. â€• William Shakespeare

"He inspires courage, for he understands that every day is a chance to open up new areas in your life,
 and with that comes a mixture of anticipation, wonder, awe and curiosity. The fool is there to show that
  you can never really tell what lies ahead, and you can only greet it with joy."
  
This is an awesome definition by Tina Gong about the fool.
